## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: .NET 9
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Serialization**: MessagePack (default), extensible to Protobuf and others
- **Networking**: ASP.NET Core for networked mode
- **Package Distribution**: NuGet packages for modular components

### Architecture Overview
AsteropeDb follows a highly modular architecture where each major component is distributed as a separate NuGet package. The core namespace is AsteropeDb, with sub-namespaces for different modules (e.g., AsteropeDb.Core, AsteropeDb.Serialization, AsteropeDb.Network). At the lowest level, the system operates as a key-value store for binary streams, with higher-level components providing serialization, indexing, and query capabilities.

The architecture is designed with future clustering and horizontal scaling in mind, using abstractions that can support both single-node and distributed deployments while maintaining API consistency.

### Storage Engine Architecture
The storage engine uses a hybrid approach optimized for different data types:
- **Memory-Mapped Files**: Used for storing large binary data, providing OS-level optimization, efficient streaming I/O, and automatic memory management without loading entire files into heap memory
- **B+ Tree Indexing**: Used for key-value lookups and metadata indexing, providing predictable O(log n) performance, efficient range queries, and natural support for ordered access and transactions

### Data Model
- **1:1 Key-to-File Mapping**: Each key stores exactly one binary file with its associated metadata
- **Atomic Operations**: All operations (store, retrieve, delete) work at the key level, ensuring consistency between binary data and metadata
- **Simplified Transaction Boundaries**: Transactions operate on complete key-value pairs, eliminating complex multi-file coordination

### Performance Requirements
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimize heap allocations where possible
- **Streaming I/O**: Support streaming reads and writes for large binary files
- **Concurrent Access**: Handle multiple simultaneous transactions efficiently
- **Large File Support**: Efficient handling of binary files up to 2^63 bytes (theoretical limit)
- **Query Performance**: Fast metadata queries with proper indexing
- **Caching Strategy**: LRU (Least Recently Used) cache implementation for frequently accessed metadata to improve query performance
- **Compression Support**: Optional compression for large binary files to reduce storage requirements and improve I/O performance
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Architecture designed for future multi-node deployments with linear performance scaling

### Security Requirements
- Authentication mechanisms for networked mode
- Data encryption support for sensitive binary data (MAYBE)
- Access control for different user roles
- Secure transaction isolation and data integrity

### Integration Requirements
